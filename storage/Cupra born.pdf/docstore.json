This is why it is so\nimportant to fasten seat belts before every trip,\neven when \"just driving around the corner\".\nEnsure that your passengers wear their seat\nbelts as well. Accident statistics have shown\nthat wearing seat belts is an effectiv e  means of\nsubstantially reducing the risk of injury and im-\nproving the chances of survival when involved\nin a serious accident. Furthermore, properly\nworn seat belts improve the protection provi-\nded by airbags in the event of an accident. For\nthis reason, wearing a seat belt is required by\nlaw in most countries.\nAlthough your vehicle is equipped with airbags,\nthe seat belts must be fastened and worn. The\nfront airbags, for example, are only triggered in\nsome cases of head-on collision. The front air-\nbags will not be triggered during minor frontal\nor side collisions, rear-end collisions, overturns\nor accidents in which the airbag trigger thresh-\nold value in the control unit is not exceeded.\nImportant safety instructions for the use of\nseat belts\n\u25cfAlways wear the seat belt as described in this\nsection.\n\u25cfEnsure that the seat belts can be fastened at\nall times and are not damaged.WARNING\n\u25cfIf seat belts are worn incorrectly or not at\nall, the risk of severe injuries increases. The\noptimal protection from seat belts can be\nachieved only if you use them properly.\n\u25cfNever allow two passengers (even children)\nto share the same seat belt.\n\u25cfNever unbuckle a seat belt while the vehi-\ncle is in motion.

Therefore, you must\ncheck the condition of all seat belts at regu-\nlar intervals.\u25cfSeat belts which have been worn in an ac-\ncident and have been stretched must be re-\nplaced by a specialised workshop. Renewal\nmay be necessary even if there is no appa-\nrent damage. The belt anchorage should also\nbe checked.\n\u25cfDo not attempt to repair a damaged seat\nbelt yourself.

ISOFIX attachment\nestablishes a rigid connection between the\nchild seat and the car body.\nThe child seat has two rigid attachment clips,\ncalled connectors. These connectors are fit-\nt ed into the ISOFIX attachment rings found\nbetween the seat cushion and the backrest\nof the vehicle's back seat (on the sides). ISO-\nFIX attachment systems are used mainly in Eu-\nrope \u203a\u203a\u203a\u00a0 page\u00a059 . If necessary, ISOFIX at-\ntachment may have to be supplemented with a\nT op T ether belt or a support bracket.\n\u25cfAutomatic three-point seat belt . Whenever\npossible, it is preferable to attach the child\nseats with the ISOFIX system rather than at-\ntaching them with an automatic three-point\nseat belt \u203a\u203a\u203a\u00a0 page\u00a063 .\nAdditional attachment:\n\u25cfT op T ether : the T op T ether belt is guided\nover the back of the rear seat and attached to\nan anchor point with a hook.

For the assembly of this type\nof seat you should also consult the list of ap-\nproved vehicles for this assembly, available in\nthe instructions for child restraint systems.\nRecommended systems for attaching child\nseats\nCUPRA recommends attaching child seats as\nfollows:\n\u25cfBaby carriers or child seats in the oppo-\nsite direction of travel : ISOFIX and support\nbracket or i-Size.\n\u25cfChild seats in the direction of travel : ISOFIX\nand T op T ether.\nWARNING\nIncorrect use of the support bracket can\ncause serious or fatal injury.\n\u25cfMake sure the support bracket is correctly\nand safely installed.\n\u25cfWhen the base of the child seat is sup-\nporting the child\u2019s weight, the support foot\nshould not hang in the air or be supplemen-ted with objects. In addition, make sure that\nthe base of the child seat is always supported\nby the surface of the vehicle's seat.

The driver is\nresponsible for driving safely \u203a\u203a\u203a\u00a0 .\nWhen the brake assist systems are regulating\nthe brakes, the brake pedal may move or make\nnoises. Even so, continue to brake with the\nnecessary force and control the trajectory of\nthe vehicle if necessary.\nDepending on the equipment, the ESC and\nTCS settings may be changed in the vehicle.\n\u25cfThe ESC, ABS and TCS can only operate cor-\nrectly if the four wheels are fitt ed  with the\nstipulated tyres \u203a\u203a\u203a\u00a0 .\n\u25cfIf a fault occurs in the ABS, the ESC, TCS and\nEDS also cease to function.\nElectronic Stability Control (ESC)\nThe ESC helps to reduce the risk of skidding\nand to improve stability in certain driving situa-\ntions \u203a\u203a\u203a\u00a0 .Traction control (TCS)\nThe TCS reduces the driving force on skidding\nwheels and adapts this force to suit the road\nsurface conditions. The TCS facilitates starting,\nacceleration and hill climbing \u203a\u203a\u203a\u00a0 .\nElectronic brake pressure distribution (EBV)\nElectronic brake force distribution (EBV) regu-\nlates the braking force between the front and\nrear axles. Excessive braking of the rear axle is\navoided and the vehicle remains stable during\nthe braking operation.\nAnti-lock braking system (ABS),\nThe ABS can prevent the wheels from locking\nup under braking until shortly before the vehi-\ncle comes to a stop, and helps the driver main-\ntain control of the steering and the vehicle \n\u203a\u203a\u203a\u00a0 .\nBrake assist (BAS)\nBrake assist (BAS) can help to reduce the brak-\ning distance. Brake Assist increases the pres-\nsure exerted by the driver when the brake\npedal is depressed quickly in an emergency.\nElectronic differ ential  lock (EDS and XDS)\nThe EDS automatically brakes skidding wheels\nand transmits the driving force to the other\ndriving wheels.\nThe XDS improves traction by applying the\nbrakes to keep the vehicle in its lane.Multi-collision brake\nThe multi-collision brake automatically triggers\nbraking if the airbag control unit detects a col-\nlision in the event of an accident.\nAutomatic braking requirements:\n\u25cfThe driver is not pressing the accelerator\npedal.\nElectromechanical brake servo (eBKV)\nWith the ignition switched on, the electrome-\nchanical brake servo (eBKV) supplements the\nforce exerted by the foot by increasing the\npressure that the driver exerts on the brake\npedal \u203a\u203a\u203a\u00a0 . When a driver assistance system\napples the brakes, e.g. ACC when regulating\nthe speed, or during emergency braking, the\nbrake pedal may move automatically.\nAfter disconnecting the ignition, the assistance\nof the brake servo is progressively reduced.

It is part of the\nelectrical system and, in the event of a fail-\nure of the high-voltage battery, it ensures that\npower is supplied to vehicle systems of rele-\nvance to safety. The 12\u00a0volt battery is checked\nand, if necessary, replaced as part of mainte-\nnance work.\nAll work on batteries requires specialist knowl-\nedge. Please refer to a specialised CUPRA\nService, SEAT Official  Service or a workshop\nspecialising in batteries: risk of burns or ex-\nploding battery!The battery must not be opened! Never try to\nchange the fluid  level of the battery. Otherwise\nexplosive gas is released from the battery that\ncould cause an explosion.\nBattery warning indications\nWear protective goggles.\nBattery acid is extremely corrosive. Wear\nprotective gloves and eye protection.\nRinse any splashes of electrolyte with\nplenty of water.\nFires, sparks, open flames  and smoking\nare prohibited.\nThe battery should only be charged in a\nwell-ventilated zone. Risk of explosion!\nKeep children away from acid and the bat-\ntery.\nAlways follow the instruction manual.\nWARNING\nWorking on the 12-volt battery and electrical\nsystem can cause severe burns, fir e  and elec-\ntric shock.

There-\nfore in the event of an accident, they could, for\nexample, consult information recorded in the\nairbag control unit which could help to clarify\nthe details of the accident.\nVehicle operating data\nThe control units process data to allow the ve-\nhicle to operate. For example:\n\u25cfVehicle status information, e.g. speed, de-\nceleration, lateral acceleration, wheel rotation,\nseat belt fastening indication, etc.\n\u25cfEnvironmental circumstances, e.g. tempera-\nture, rain and light sensor, distance control\nsensors, etc.\nAs a rule, this data is transitory, is not stored\nbeyond the operating time and is only pro-\ncessed by the vehicle itself. The control units\nusually contain data memories. These memo-\nries are used to temporarily or permanently\ndocument information on the status of the ve-\nhicle, to order components and maintenance\nrequirements, as well as technical incidents\nand faults.Depending on the technical equipment, the\nfollowing information is stored:\n\u25cfStatus of system components, e.g. fill levels,\ntyre pressure, battery status, etc.\n\u25cfFaults and defects in major system compo-\nnents, e.g. lights, brakes, etc.\n\u25cfReactions of systems in special driving situa-\ntions, e.g. when an airbag triggers, the inter-\nvention of stability regulation systems, etc.\n\u25cfInformation on incidents that could cause\ndamage or faults in the vehicle.\nIn special cases, e.g. if the vehicle detects a\nmalfunction, it may be necessary to save data\nthat would otherwise only be kept temporarily.\nWhen using services such as repair or mainte-\nnance services, the stored operating data as\nwell as the vehicle identification  number can\nbe retrieved and used if necessary. These data\ncan be accessed by employees of the Service\nnetwork, e.g. workshops, or third parties, e.g.\nemployees of roadside assistance services in\nthe event of a breakdown. This also applies to\ncases of warranties or implementation of qual-\nity assurance measures.\nThe data is retrieved over the vehicle\u2019s OBD\n(On-Board-Diagnosis) connection, which is re-\nquired by law \u203a\u203a\u203a\u00a0 .

If necessary, these data, particularly\ninformation on component orders, technicalincidents, operating errors and other faults,\nare transmitted to CUPRA along with the ve-\nhicle identification  number. In addition, the\nmanufacturer is liable for damages caused by\na defective product. CUPRA also uses vehicle\noperating data for this purpose, e.g. for recall\ncampaigns. These data can also be used to\ncheck customer claims where they wish to take\nadvantage of a legal or commercial warranty.\nT echnical service workshops can reset the ve-\nhicle's fault memories during repair or mainte-\nnance work, or at your request.\nMake sure that only specialised workshops re-\ntrieve and reset the incident memories.

This includes data such as whether\nthe systems were inactive or active and if such\naction had an impact on the vehicle\u2019s dynamic\nbehaviour, changing its path in the aforemen-\ntioned situations, accelerating or decelerating\nthe vehicle.\nDepending on vehicle equipment, this in-\ncludes data from systems such as:\n\u25cfthe adaptive cruise control\n\u25cfthe lane assist system\n\u25cfparking assistants\n\u25cfthe emergency brake functions.\nThe EDR data are only recorded in specific  ac-\ncident situations. No data are recorded in nor-\nmal driving conditions.No audio or video data inside or around the\nvehicle are recorded. Under no circumstances\nare personal data such as name, age, or gen-\nder recorded. Nevertheless, third parties (such\nas criminal proceedings authorities) may relate\nthe contents of the EDR data to other data\nsources and create a personal reference in the\ncontext of an accident investigation.\nIn order to read the EDR data it is necessary\nto access (if legally permitted to do so) the ve-\nhicle's ODB (\u201cOn-Board-Diagnose\u201d) interface\nwhile the vehicle is switched on.\nCUPRA will not have access to EDR data unless\nthe owner (or, in \u201cLeasing\u201d cases, the lessee\nor hirer) gives their consent. There may be\nexceptions to this, depending on legal or con-\ntractual provisions.\nDue to legal requirements in safety-related\nproducts, CUPRA may use the EDR data for\nfield  research and in order to improve vehicle\nsystem quality.
